    "Sure, I'll break down the code and explain each part in simple terms:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def tic_tac_toe(board):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Tic Tac Toe.\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Get the size of the board\n",
    "    size = len(board)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function `tic_tac_toe` takes a `board` as input, which is a list of lists representing the tic-tac-toe board.\n",
    "2. The first line inside the function gets the size of the board by using `len(board)`. This gives us the number of rows (and columns) in the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Check rows\n",
    "    for row in board:\n",
    "        if len(set(row)) == 1 and row[0] != \"\":\n",
    "            return row[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function then checks each row of the board to see if all the elements in the row are the same non-empty symbol.\n",
    "4. It does this by iterating over each row using a `for` loop.\n",
    "5. For each row, it checks if the length of the set of unique elements in the row is 1 (meaning all elements are the same) and if the first element of the row is not an empty string.\n",
    "6. If both conditions are true, it means all the elements in the row are the same non-empty symbol, so the function returns that symbol as the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Check columns\n",
    "    for i in range(size):\n",
    "        col = [board[j][i] for j in range(size)]\n",
    "        if len(set(col)) == 1 and col[0] != \"\":\n",
    "            return col[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Next, the function checks each column of the board to see if all the elements in the column are the same non-empty symbol.\n",
    "8. It does this by iterating over the column indices using `range(size)`.\n",
    "9. For each column index `i`, it creates a list `col` that contains the elements in that column by accessing the `i`-th element in each row.\n",
    "10. It then checks if the length of the set of unique elements in `col` is 1 and if the first element of `col` is not an empty string.\n",
    "11. If both conditions are true, it means all the elements in the column are the same non-empty symbol, so the function returns that symbol as the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Check diagonals\n",
    "    diag1 = [board[i][i] for i in range(size)]\n",
    "    diag2 = [board[i][size-i-1] for i in range(size)]\n",
    "    if len(set(diag1)) == 1 and diag1[0] != \"\":\n",
    "        return diag1[0]\n",
    "    if len(set(diag2)) == 1 and diag2[0] != \"\":\n",
    "        return diag2[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Finally, the function checks the two diagonals of the board to see if all the elements in either diagonal are the same non-empty symbol.\n",
    "13. It creates a list `diag1` that contains the elements on the main diagonal by accessing the `i`-th element in the `i`-th row and column.\n",
    "14. It creates a list `diag2` that contains the elements on the other diagonal by accessing the `i`-th element in the `size-i-1`-th column (starting from the right side).\n",
    "15. It checks if the length of the set of unique elements in `diag1` is 1 and if the first element of `diag1` is not an empty string.\n",
    "16. If both conditions are true, it means all the elements in the main diagonal are the same non-empty symbol, so the function returns that symbol as the winner.\n",
    "17. It performs a similar check for `diag2` to see if all the elements in the other diagonal are the same non-empty symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # No winner\n",
    "    return \"NO WINNER\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If none of the rows, columns, or diagonals have all the same non-empty symbol, it means there is no winner, so the function returns the string `\"NO WINNER\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `tic_tac_toe` function checks each row, column, and diagonal of the tic-tac-toe board to see if any of them have all the same non-empty symbol. If it finds such a row, column, or diagonal, it returns that symbol as the winner. If no winner is found, it returns `\"NO WINNER\"`.\n",
